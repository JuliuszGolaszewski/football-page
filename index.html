                Now, if you don't know rules of football here are rules:
                Football matches are played between two teams and typically last for 90 minutes. The match is divided into two halves of 45 minutes each.
                There's a 15-minute break called half-time which separates the two halves. A match kicks off from the centre circle with
                one team in possession of the ball. The teams switch sides after half-time, with the other team in possession and kicking off proceedings.
                The objective of each team is to kick or head the football within the opposing teamâ€™s goalposts to score a goal. There are 11 players on
                each side with one goalkeeper protecting the goal - being an exception he can use hands in a penalty area.
